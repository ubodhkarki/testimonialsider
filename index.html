I built this slider when I first started to learn JS, you can rebuild it with more readable, simple and less code, I'm too lazy to update it, sorry :)

                        <p>"Focusing on Email Marketing was one of the best decisions, I’ve made so far with Mails Avenue. I have been completely ignoring the potential of Emails but Mails Avenue helped me get those extra Pie from Emails. The email flows and campaigns were so intricate and effective plus these guys are so pleasant to work with"</p>

The emails are perfectly integrated with my branding and they keep everything seamless. I get updates and I am easily able to make changes and have everything run, I only focus on my ads apart from that Mails Avenue has completely handled our customer interaction."</p>

One of the best ROIs, especially since I see more and more success with the funnels they built for my business. Great teamwork and very cooperative.
